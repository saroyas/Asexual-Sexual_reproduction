# Asexual-Sexual_reproduction
A brief description:

Investigating mathematical models which attempt to explain the prevalence of Sexual replication, despite it's seeming 
evolutionary costs. I focus on the performance of asexual vs sexual replication strategies on random fitness landscape 
(Euclidean) in N dimensions.

The initial results of the simulations have suggested a hypothesis that extends the work of Andrew Lewis Pye's Paper:
Sex vs Asex: the role of varience conversion (https://lewispye.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/svsastp3.pdf). It seems that
the papers results may be generalisable to many different fitness landscapes (comapred to just the linear or product cases
considered in the paper). Namely, sexual recombination increases varience of the sexual population in 'diagonal'
directions, enabling it to move faster into such directions. This enables the sexual population to excel when moving in
these 'diagonal' directions confers a fitness advantage. Not only that, but the sexual recombination process entails
no disadvantage when moving 'not diagonally', meaning it is competitive in that case also!

You can expect a full formal analysis up here by June 2020.

Background note:

Sexual replication has many seeming issues in comparison to asexual replication. From the nineteenth century, it has 
been recognized that, since there is no obvious advantage to the individuals involved, the advantages of sexual reproduction 
must be evolutionary. Furthermore, the advantage must be substantial; for example, producing males entails a two-fold cost, 
compared to dispensing with them and reproducing by parthenogenetic females. There are a large number of plausible hypotheses. 
To me the most popular of these are two: The first hypothesis, and the oldest, is that sexual reproduction offers the 
opportunity to produce recombinant types that can make the population better able to keep up with changes in the environment. 
Second, species with sexual recombination can bunch harmful mutations together and eliminate several in a single 
"genetic death." Asexual species, can eliminate them only in the same genotype in which they occurred.
